Weed Control:
Method: Intercultural operations before top dressing with fertilizer.
Pest Management:
Diamondback Moth (Plutella xylostella):

Symptoms: Green larvae feeding on leaves, leaving papery epidermis. Severe infestations disrupt head formation.
Cabbage Looper (Chrysodeixis eriosoma):

Symptoms: Irregular holes in leaves, larval excrement at leaf bases.
Tobacco Cutworm (Spodoptera litura):

Symptoms: Leaf skeletonization and irregular holes.
Black Cutworm (Agrotis spp):

Symptoms: Round leaf holes, plants cut at base during emergence.
Root Maggot (Delia spp):

Symptoms: Wilting leaves, maggots visible on roots.
Aphids:

Symptoms: Sap sucking, leaf malformation, and contamination of edible parts.
Slugs and Snails:

Symptoms: Irregular holes on leaves, severe during high rainfall.
Pest Management Techniques:
General Practices:

Proper nursery management.
Regular field monitoring.
Crop rotation and field sanitation.
Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides to protect predators and parasitoids.
Chemical Controls:

Diamondback Moth: Emamectin benzoate, Etofenprox.
Cabbage Looper: Spinosad, Chlorfluazuron.
Tobacco Cutworm: Etofenprox, Chlorantraniliprole.
Black Cutworm: Profenofos, Etofenprox.
Root Maggot: Fipronil.
Aphids: Thiamethoxam, Imidacloprid.
Slugs and Snails: Metaldehyde.
Disease Management:
Club Root Disease:

Control: Use disease-free materials, increase soil pH with lime, crop rotation.
Cercospora Leaf Spot:

Control: Field sanitation, fungicides like Mancozeb, Propineb.
Black Rot:

Control: Use healthy seeds, maintain drainage, and crop rotation.
Head Rot:

Control: Field sanitation, fungicides like Chlorothalonil.
Cabbage Ring Spot:

Control: Use healthy materials, field sanitation, Hexaconazole.
Downy Mildew:

Control: Field sanitation, weed control, fungicides like Mancozeb.
