Weed Control:

Weed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-planting.
Apply fertilizer after weeding.
Disease Management:

Damping Off: Control through nursery sterilization and crop rotation.
Anthracnose: Use resistant varieties, field sanitation, and improve drainage.
Bacterial Wilt: Rotate with non-host crops, use resistant varieties, and remove infected plants.
Leaf Curl Virus: Use disease-free seeds, control whitefly vectors, and remove infected plants.
Leaf Spot Disease: Practice field sanitation, maintain spacing, and use fungicides as needed.
Powdery Mildew: Ensure good air circulation, use resistant varieties, and apply fungicides preventatively.
Choanephora Blight: Maintain recommended spacing, remove infected plant parts promptly.
