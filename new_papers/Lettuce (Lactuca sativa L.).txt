Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.)
Overview
Lettuce is an annual plant in the Asteraceae family, commonly grown as a leaf vegetable for salads and used in soups, sandwiches, wraps, and even grilled dishes.

Climatic Requirements
Suitable for year-round cultivation in Upcountry Wet and Upcountry Intermediate Zones, where cool climates prevail.
Optimal growth temperature: Less than 20Â°C.
In hot climates, lettuce tends to have a bitter taste, early flowering, and increased internodal length, leading to taller plants.
Soil Requirements
Prefers well-drained sandy loam soil with a loose structure and rich organic matter content.
Land Preparation
Plough the soil to a depth of about 30 cm.
Create raised beds approximately 1 m wide and of manageable length.
Nursery Management
Prepare nursery beds to a fine texture and enrich with organic manure.
Sow seeds in rows with 10 cm spacing.
Transplant seedlings to permanent ground about three weeks after germination.
Transplanting
Transplant in raised beds with 30 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants.
When grown as a mixed crop with carrots and leeks, use 20 cm spacing between plants.
Fertilizer Application
Organic Manure
Type: Poultry manure, cattle manure, compost.
Application Time: 3-5 days before planting.
Quantity: 10 t/ha.
Chemical Fertilizer
Application Time: One day before transplanting.
Quantity:
Urea: 215 kg/ha.
TSP: 130 kg/ha.
MOP: 75 kg/ha.
Lime/Dolomite
Application Time: Two weeks before planting.
Quantity: 1-2 t/ha.
Irrigation/Water Supply
Provide a good water supply for quality growth.
Water daily during the initial days after planting.
After two weeks, adjust watering to every four days, depending on rainfall.
Weed Control
Maintain a weed-free field to support proper crop growth.
Hand weeding is recommended.
Pest Management
1. Root Eating Caterpillars
Damage: Larvae damage roots and lower stems, entering the plant.
Control: Capture and destroy adults using yellow or blue sticky traps.
2. Cutworms
Damage: Caterpillars cut seedlings at the base.
Control: Inspect crops and apply recommended pesticides when necessary.
Disease Management
1. Soft Rot
Conditions: Severe under high humidity, infection from lower leaves in contact with soil.
Control: Ensure proper spacing and prevent lower leaves from touching the soil. Use polythene mulch to reduce soil contact.
2. Sclerotium Rot
Symptoms: Rotting of lower leaves and stems, spreading upwards; white mold in high humidity.
Control: Improve drainage, ensure proper plant spacing, and prevent lower leaves from touching the soil.
Harvesting
Harvest 50-60 days after transplanting.
Remove the entire plant and cut off the roots. Home gardeners can harvest leaves individually as needed.
A well-grown plant should weigh between 200-400 g.
Yield
Single crop yield: 15-17 tons per hectare.
