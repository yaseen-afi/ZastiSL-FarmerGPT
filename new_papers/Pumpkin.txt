Pumpkin Cultivation in Sri Lanka

Botanical Information:

Scientific Name: Cucurbita maxima
Released Varieties: Pathma, A.N.K., Local Strains, Butternut
Climatic Requirements and Areas Suitable for Cultivation:

Suitable up to an elevation of 500 m in the dry and intermediate zones.
Pumpkin is typically grown as a Yala crop, while squash can be grown in both Maha and Yala seasons.
Soil Requirements:

Soil should be rich in humus with a pH range of 5.5 – 7.5.
Seed Requirement:

1 kg/ha
Land Preparation:

Plough to a depth of about 20-30 cm and harrow for fine tilth.
Create planting holes 30 x 30 x 30 cm.
Add 5 kg of organic matter per planting hole, mix with soil, and heap to about 10 cm above ground level.
Planting:

Plant after heavy rains.
Local Strains and A.N.K.: Dibble 4 seeds per planting hole (10 cm between seeds).
Butternut: Use seeds with high germination (2 seeds/hill) or low germination (3 seeds/hill); thin to 2 plants/hill 2 weeks after emergence.
Alternatively, seedlings can be raised in polythene bags or Noridoko nurseries to mitigate adverse weather conditions.
Spacing:

Local Strain: 3 x 3 m
A.N.K.: 2.5 x 2.5 m
Butternut: 50 x 100 cm
Fertilization:

Basal: 75 kg/ha of Urea, 200 kg/ha of TSP (Triple Super Phosphate), 60 kg/ha of MOP (Muriate of Potash).
Top dressing: Apply the same quantities 4 and 8 weeks after planting.
Water Supply/Irrigation:

Make shallow drains 25 cm away from planting hills for irrigation or drainage purposes.
Initially, irrigate daily until germination is complete; thereafter, irrigate every 7 days until beds reach field capacity, avoiding submergence of vines.
Weed Control:

Hand weed and apply straw mulch 3 weeks after germination.
Harvesting:

Harvest when the fruit develops a powdery film.
A.N.K.: Harvest 40 days after flowering.
Local Variety: Harvest 60 days after flowering.
Butternut: Harvest 20 days after flowering.
Yield:

Average yields for all varieties range from 15,000 – 20,000 kg/ha.
Post-harvest:

Pumpkins can be stored for 6 – 8 months.
Butternut can be kept for about 1 month under ambient conditions.
Disease Management:
Fungal Diseases:

Powdery Mildew:

Causal Organism: Podosphaera xanthii
Symptoms: Pale yellow spots on older leaves, white fluffy mycelium, defoliation.
Management: Use recommended fungicides early, remove infected plant debris.
Downy Mildew:

Causal Organism: Pseudoperonospora cubensis
Symptoms: Angular yellow spots, chlorosis, necrosis.
Management: Early fungicide application, remove infected debris.
Collar Rot/Root Rot:

Causal Organisms: Sclerotium spp., Fusarium spp.
Symptoms: Wilting, yellowing, plant death.
Management: Destroy infected plants, improve drainage, fungicide use.
Gummy Stem Blight:

Causal Organism: Didymella bryoniae
Symptoms: Lesions, fruit damage, plant collapse.
Management: Deep plow after harvest, fungicide application.
Bacterial Diseases:
5. Bacterial Wilt:

Causal Organism: Ralstonia solanacearum
Symptoms: Sudden wilting, brown leaves, vascular discoloration.
Management: Destroy infected plants, crop rotation, avoid spreading agents.
Viral Diseases:
6. Leaf Curl Virus (LCV):

Transmitted by: Whitefly (Bemicia tabaci)
Symptoms: Leaf curling, stunted growth, deformed fruits.
Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRSV):

Transmitted by: Aphids
Symptoms: Mosaic leaves, fruit malformation.
Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV):

Transmission: Seed-borne, sap.
Symptoms: Leaf mottling, fruit deformation.
Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV):

Symptoms: Stunting, mosaic leaves, fruit discoloration.
Phytoplasma Disease:

Symptoms: Smaller leaves, stunted growth, witch’s broom effect.
Transmission: Leafhoppers.
Control: Remove infected plants, control vectors.
