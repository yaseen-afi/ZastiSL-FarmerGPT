Climatic Requirements
Suitable for cultivation throughout the country except in arid zones.
Optimal temperature range: 20-40°C.
Soil Requirements
Prefers sandy or loam soil with good drainage.
Cutting Requirement
For 1 hectare: 55,000 – 60,000 cuttings.
Nursery Management
Establish nurseries every 5 seasons to maintain vigor.
Use tuber planting in nurseries to produce cuttings for field planting.
Land Preparation
Plough the land to a depth of 25 cm to facilitate soil aeration and drainage.
Planting
Optimal vegetative growth occurs in the Yala season with good irrigation.
Spacing
Ridge and Furrow System:
90 cm distance within furrow.
20 cm distance between plants.
Beds:
Beds are 60 cm wide.
20 cm distance between plants.
Fertilizer Application
Use organic fertilizers.
Apply inorganic fertilizers at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after planting.
Inorganic Fertilizer Schedule:
2 Weeks After Planting (Basal):
Urea: 60 kg/ha
TSP: 120 kg/ha
MOP: 120 kg/ha
6 Weeks After Planting (Top Dressing):
Urea: 60 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Water Supply
Ensure adequate water supply during the initial growth stage.
Avoid excess water as it reduces tuber production.
Weed Control
Remove weeds early to reduce competition for nutrients and sunlight.
Pest Management
Employ crop rotation, timely harvesting, and debris removal.
Key Pest: Sweet potato weevil is the most harmful pest.
Disease Management
No major diseases affecting yield have been reported in Sri Lanka.
Root Rot Diseases:
Causal Organism: Fusarium spp.
Symptoms: Yellowing leaves, wilting vines, and root rot.
Management: Remove and discard diseased plants and soil.
Harvesting
Harvest 3 to 4 months after planting.
Maturity is indicated by latex secretion from damaged vine areas.
Immature tubers produce high latex.
Yield
Average yield: 15-25 t/ha.
