Water Supply
Critical during tuberization and bulking stages.
Requires about 70% available water for high yields.
Preferable irrigation methods: sprinkler or drip.
Weed Control
Pre-emergent herbicide (metribuzine) or intercultural operations at 2 and 4 weeks after planting.
Pest Management
Common Pests: Leaf miner, potato tuber moth, black cut worm, golden cyst nematode, potato aphid, thrips, whitefly, white grub, slug and snail.
Various management strategies including cultural, biological, and chemical controls for each pest.
Disease Management
Common Diseases: Late blight, early blight, common scab, black scurf, powdery scab, bacterial wilt, dry rot, virus diseases.
Strategies include crop rotation, use of disease-free tubers, application of fungicides, and control of vectors.
Harvesting
Remove haulms 2 weeks before harvesting for tuber maturation.
Yield
Expected yield: 20-25 tons per hectare.
