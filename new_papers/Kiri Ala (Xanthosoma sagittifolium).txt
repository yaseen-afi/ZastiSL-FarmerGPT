Kiri Ala (Xanthosoma sagittifolium)
Overview
Kiri Ala, also known as tannia or arrowleaf elephant ear, is a highly nutritious crop. It is economically profitable due to its low input requirements and ability to grow in marginal lands with low risk. It can be cultivated year-round under irrigation.

Released Varieties
Isuru
Climatic Requirements
Requires about 1500 mm of annual rainfall.
Prefers high temperatures with intermittent dry periods.
Soil Requirements
Optimal pH: 5.5 - 6.5.
Prefers soil with high organic matter and good drainage.
Cutting Requirement
9000-10,000 plants per hectare.
Nursery Management
Use mother corms as planting material.
Cut mother corms into 2-2.5 inches wide sections and treat with fungicide or ash.
Plant in a sand nursery in a shaded area or in a mixture of topsoil, organic fertilizer, and sand (1:1:1 ratio). Maintain a 3-4 inch distance between cuttings.
Cover cuttings with straw and irrigate.
Plants are ready for field establishment when they have 4-5 leaves at about 1.5-2 months old.
Land Preparation
Plough the land and prepare holes of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm for normal soil, or 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm for hard soil.
Fill holes with organic matter.
Planting
Use 1.5-month-old plants from the nursery, ensuring the root system is intact.
Plant during both Yala and Maha seasons with adequate irrigation.
Spacing
1 m x 1 m.
Fertilizer Application
Use as much organic fertilizer as possible, supplemented with inorganic fertilizers as recommended by the Department of Agriculture.
Fertilizer Schedule for 1 ha:
Basal Application (3 days before planting or 2 weeks after planting):
Urea: 30 kg
TSP: 120 kg
MOP: 60 kg
Top Dressing One (1.5-2 months after planting):
Urea: 60 kg
MOP: 60 kg
Top Dressing Two (3-3.5 months after planting):
Urea: 60 kg
MOP: 60 kg
Reduce nitrogen application after 4-4.5 months to decrease vegetative growth and increase corm formation.
Water Supply
Regular irrigation is crucial. Leaves may burn during dry periods without adequate water.
Weed Control
Control weeds, especially during the initial growth stage of the crop.
Disease Management
Yellowing of Leaves
Symptoms: Leaf yellowing, corm rot, root rot.
Management:
Ensure well-ventilated soil with good drainage.
Use half-burnt paddy husk to improve soil aeration.
For chemical control, immerse corms in a recommended fungicide for about 30 minutes before planting.
Homai WP: 5 g/5 l
Thiram WP: 7 g/5 l
Harvesting
Harvest at 8-10 months. Indications of maturity include reduced leaf length and growth rate.
Yield
Average yield: 14-15 t/ha.
Average corm weight: 125-150 g.
Training
Reduce vegetative growth by cutting surface roots.
