Released Varieties
While there are no officially recommended varieties by the Department of Agriculture, many local varieties are popular among farmers.
Climatic Requirements
Grows well in tropical climates with temperatures ranging from 30°C to 35°C.
Can be cultivated up to 1000 m above sea level.
Suitable for year-round cultivation.
Soil Requirements
Grows in a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils rich in organic matter.
Optimal pH range: 5.5 – 7.5.
Seed Requirement
500 g of seeds per hectare.
One gram of seeds contains approximately 90-100 seeds.
Spacing
Inter-row and intra-row spacing: 1.0 m.
Land Preparation and Planting
Plough the soil to a depth of 20-30 cm and break up large clumps.
Prepare 30 cm³ planting holes and fill them with decomposed organic matter mixed with topsoil to a height of 10 cm.
Plant 3-4 seeds in each pit, thinning to two healthy seedlings after two weeks.
Cultivation Time
Suitable for year-round cultivation.
Fertilizer Application
Fertilizer Schedule:
Basal Application:
Urea: 75 kg/ha
TSP: 200 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Top Dressing (4 weeks after emergence):
Urea: 75 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Top Dressing (8 weeks after emergence):
Urea: 75 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Note: Conduct a soil test to determine optimal phosphorus and potassium requirements.
Irrigation
Daily irrigation is necessary until seeds germinate.
Water every 3-4 days thereafter, depending on climate and soil conditions.
Avoid over-irrigation to prevent vine and seed rot.
Weed Control
Control weeds during the early stages.
Use mulching to help control weeds.
Pest Management
Common pests include melon fly, Aulacophora beetle, Epilachna beetle, aphids, and whiteflies.
Use recommended pesticides and maintain field sanitation.
Disease Management
1. Powdery Mildew
Causal Organism: Erysiphe spp.
Symptoms: Spots on upper leaf surfaces, yellowing, and whitening of leaves. Fruits remain unaffected.
Management:
Apply recommended fungicides.
Maintain field sanitation.
Use high-quality seeds.
Recommended fungicides: Mancozeb, Captan.
2. Downy Mildew
Causal Organism: Pseudoperonospora cubensis.
Symptoms: Yellow patches on leaves that turn brown, white fungal growth on undersides of leaves.
Management:
Apply recommended fungicides.
Maintain field sanitation.
Recommended fungicides: Mancozeb + Metalaxyl, Captan, Flutriafol, Potassium bicarbonate, Azoxystrobin.
3. Soft Rot Disease
Causal Organism: Pythium spp.
Symptoms: Brown, water-soaked lesions that expand into soft, rotten areas, often with white mycelium in humid conditions.
Management:
Apply recommended fungicides.
Maintain field sanitation.
Recommended fungicides: Thiram, Thiophanate methyl + Thiram, Topsin.
Harvesting
Harvest when fruits are mature by cutting the stalk with a sharp knife.
Yield
Expected yield: 25,000 – 30,000 kg per hectare.
