Climatic Requirements
Suitable for cultivation up to 1500 m elevation.
Can be cultivated year-round.
Requires 1000-1500 mm annual rainfall and temperatures of 25-29Â°C.
Soil Requirements
Optimal pH: 5-6.
Not suitable for waterlogged or alkaline soils.
Cutting Requirement
Standard: 12,000-13,000 cuttings per hectare (90 cm x 90 cm spacing).
High branching varieties: 6,400-6,500 cuttings per hectare.
For export: 17,000-18,000 cuttings per hectare.
Nursery Management
Direct planting of cuttings.
For healthier cuttings, maintain a special cultivation area to avoid disease spread through planting materials.
Land Preparation
Till the land and plant at the onset of rain.
Planting
Wet Zone: Plant during both Yala and Maha seasons.
Dry Zone: Plant during Maha season.
Use single holes or ridges.
Bag cultivation uses 50 kg polysacks filled with loam soil.
Spacing
High Branching: 125 cm x 125 cm.
For Export: 75 cm x 75 cm.
Medium Branching: 90 cm x 90 cm.
Fertilizer Application
Use organic fertilizers and supplement with recommended inorganic fertilizers.
Fertilizer Schedule:
After 15 Days:
Urea: 85 kg/ha
TSP: 120 kg/ha
MOP: 125 kg/ha
After 2.5-3 Months:
Urea: 85 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
After 4-4.5 Months:
Urea: 85 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Water Supply
Ensure adequate water or soil moisture, especially during the early stages.
Weed Control
Critical during the early stages until the crop covers the ground.
Pest Management
Whiteflies: Act as vectors for viral diseases.
Control measures include using neem extracts, live fencing, mixed cropping with maize, and water spraying from above.
Disease Management
1. Sri Lanka Cassava Mosaic Virus (SLCMV)
Symptoms:
Yellow and green spots on leaves.
Curled leaves and reduced leaf area.
Plant stunting and weakened yield.
Transmission:
Through cuttings from diseased plants.
Spread by whiteflies.
Management:
Use only healthy cuttings.
Remove and destroy diseased plants and wild host plants.
Avoid planting new crops near diseased fields.
Maintain field cleanliness and weed control.
Mark and remove diseased plants during harvesting.
2. Brown Leaf Spot Disease
Causal Organism: Mycosphaerella spp.
Symptoms:
Brown spots on leaves.
Mature lower leaves are infected first.
Severe infection spreads to upper leaves, causing yellowing and defoliation.
Management:
Remove and burn infected leaves in home gardens.
Use fungicides like Mancozeb 80% WP (32 g per 16 liters of water) in commercial fields.
3. Collar Rot / Root Rot
Causal Organism: Sclerotium spp.
Symptoms:
Root and stem rotting.
Yellowing leaves leading to plant death.
White fungal networks at the plant base.
Transmission:
Spread by infected soil and water.
Management:
Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
Remove and discard diseased plants and soil.
Harvesting
Harvest at 9-12 months.
Kirikawadi can be harvested from 6 months.
Yield
Average yield: 35-40 t/ha.
