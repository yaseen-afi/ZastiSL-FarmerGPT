Kohila (Lasia spinosa)
Overview
Kohila, also known as Lasia spinosa, is a popular and nutritious vegetable in Sri Lanka. Its leaves and rhizomes are consumed for their health benefits, particularly for treating hemorrhoids and stomach aches due to their high fiber content.

Available Types
Local Kohila: Slow growth, low yield, small and less fleshy rhizomes, fewer leaf segments.
Exotic Kohila: Fast growth, high yield, larger and fleshy rhizomes, more leaf segments.
Climatic Requirements
Grows well in shady environments, suitable for wetlands.
Soil Requirements
Prefers waterlogged soils.
Best suited for wetlands with frequent waterlogging.
Field Preparation and Planting
Prepare the field by ploughing to a depth of 20-25 cm.
Maintain beds about 5 feet wide, ensuring waterlogging is controlled.
Regularly bury a few rows of stalks in the soil at intervals.
Cultivation Time
Can be cultivated year-round, given appropriate environmental conditions.
Planting Material
Use apex cuttings of 20-25 cm (8-10 inches) in size.
Lateral shoots from mature kohila stems can also be used.
In shaded, muddy beds, shallowly bury stems to promote shoot emergence.
Spacing
Ensure proper weed control by ploughing the soil and managing water drainage.
Maintain beds about 5 feet wide and ensure regular intervals for planting stalks.
Fertilizer Application
Apply organic fertilizers and green manures before starting cultivation.
Use cattle manure as organic fertilizer, but be mindful of potential weed problems.
Chemical Fertilizer Schedule (Kg/100 m²):
Basic Fertilizer:
Urea: 1.0
TSP: 1.5
MOP: 1.0
4 Weeks After Top Dressing:
Urea: 1.0
TSP: 1.0
After Each Harvest:
Urea: 1.5
MOP: 1.5
Water Supply/Irrigation
Ensure adequate moisture without prolonged water exposure.
Regularly irrigate the crop to maintain optimal moisture levels.
Weed Control
Weeds are a major challenge in kohila cultivation.
Use straw mulch after planting to control weeds.
Apply mulch at different stages of cultivation to manage weeds effectively.
Disease Management
1. Tuber Rotting
Causal Organism: Fusarium spp.
Symptoms: Tuber surface rot, leaf yellowing.
Management:
Remove water from the bed.
Apply lime (40 g per square foot) or fungicide (Homai, Captan, Thiram) as per instructions.
2. Bacterial Tuber Rotting
Causal Organism: Ralstonia solanacearum.
Symptoms: Rotten tubers, brown inside, oozing when submerged in water.
Management:
Remove infected plants.
Apply lime after removing water from the bed.
Harvesting
Leaves can be harvested 8-12 months after planting.
Yields about 2,000 – 2,500 kg of rhizomes and 150 bundles of leaves per 50 m².
