Innala (Coleus rotundifolius / Solenostemon rotundifolius)
Overview
Innala, commonly known as Chinese potato, is cultivated for its tubers and thrives in well-drained, sandy loam soils. It requires a significant temperature difference between day and night for optimal tuber formation.

Released Varieties
Binari
Climatic Requirements
Best grown with year-round rainfall distribution.
High day and night temperature variation is crucial for tuber formation.
Ideal growing regions include:
Wet Zone: Galle, Kalutara, Colombo, Gampaha, Matale, Matara, and Ratnapura districts.
Intermediate Zone: Kurunegala.
Dry Zone: Hambantota (minor cultivation).
Soil Requirements
Prefers well-drained, light sandy loam soil.
Cutting Requirement
Nursery size should be 12%-15% of the total cultivation area.
Nursery Management
Use sprouted, healthy tubers as planting material.
Induce sprouting by spreading seed tubers on a cement floor.
Plant sprouted tubers in nursery beds with 50 cm x 50 cm spacing.
Fertilizer for Nursery (per 4 m² bed):
Urea: 15 g
TSP: 25 g
MOP: 40 g
Cow dung: 10-12 kg
To enhance shoot growth, apply liquid fertilizer or cattle urine:
At 3-6 Weeks:
Cattle urine diluted 1:1 with water or liquid fertilizers like Albert solution, Green care, Crop master.
At 2-3 Weeks:
Urea: 10 g per m²
MOP: 10 g per m²
Land Preparation
Lightly plough the land for better tuber formation.
Prepare holes 1’x1’x1’ feet and fill with organic matter before planting.
Planting
Plant according to the season and climatic zone:
Wet Zone: June-July with the onset of rain.
Dry Zone: September-October with the onset of heavy rain.
Third Season Cultivation: August, after paddy harvest.
Spacing:
Nursery: 50 cm x 50 cm, one tuber per hill.
Yala Season: 30 cm x 30 cm cuttings.
Maha Season: 15 cm x 15 cm cuttings.
Fertilizer Application
Use both organic and inorganic fertilizers to achieve high-quality yields.
Organic Manure: Cow dung is recommended.
Fertilizer Schedule:
Before Planting:
TSP: 150 kg/ha
2 Weeks After Planting (WAP):
Urea: 65 kg/ha
MOP: 60 kg/ha
6-8 WAP:
Urea: 65 kg/ha
MOP: 90 kg/ha
10-12 WAP:
MOP: 60 kg/ha
Apply fertilizer before flowering.
If soil pH is below 5, apply 1-2 kg/ha dolomite two weeks before planting.
Final MOP application is crucial for large, quality tubers.
Water Supply
Water supply depends on rainfall and specific area conditions.
Weed Control
Control weeds in the nursery and during the first month of crop growth.
Pest Management
Common Pests:
Cutworm (Spodoptera litura): Reported in the last 2-3 years.
Nematode Damage: Occurs with repeated cultivation.
Control Measures:
Practice crop rotation.
Apply poultry manure to the soil.
Use healthy seed tubers.
Disease Management
No significant diseases have been reported, but nematode damage can occur with prolonged cultivation.
Management:
Use healthy seed tubers.
Apply organic chicken manure.
Harvesting
Harvest from January to February when the plant’s vegetative parts turn yellow.
Use a hand fork to carefully expose tubers to avoid damage.
Yield
Average Yield: 10-12 tons/ha.
Potential Yield: 18-20 tons/ha (in lowland areas).
