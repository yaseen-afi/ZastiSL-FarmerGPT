Knol Khol (Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes)
Overview
Knol Khol, also known as Kohlrabi, is a vegetable in the cabbage family cultivated as an annual. It is often grown as a mixed crop with other vegetables.

Released Varieties
Only recommended imported varieties are available.
Climatic Requirements
Requires a significant day and night temperature difference for knob (swollen stem) development.
Best grown in Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts, suitable for wet and intermediate zones of the upcountry.
Cultivation in mid-country and low-country is best during the Maha season.
Soil Requirements
Prefers well-drained soil rich in organic matter with a pH around 5.5.
Time of Cultivation
The Maha season is the most suitable for cultivation.
Start nurseries in mid-August and establish fields in September.
Cultivation in October or later negatively affects knob development.
Seed Requirement
Short Duration Varieties: 600 – 750 g/ha.
Long Duration Varieties: 375 – 400 g/ha.
Spacing
Between Rows: 30 cm.
Within Rows: 10 cm.
Intercropping with Cabbage: 50 x 50 cm.
Intercropping with Curry Chili: 60 x 60 cm.
Land Preparation and Planting
Prepare the land by ploughing and leveling to remove weeds.
Use 3-4 week old seedlings, about 8-10 cm tall, for planting in prepared holes according to the recommended spacing.
One gram of seeds can produce around 250 seedlings.
Nursery Management
Follow the same management practices as cabbage nurseries.
Fertilizer Application
Fertilizer Schedule:
Before Planting:
Urea: 85 kg/ha.
Triple Super Phosphate (TSP): 110 kg/ha.
Muriate of Potash (MOP): 65 kg/ha.
2 Weeks After Transplanting:
Urea: 85 kg/ha.
MOP: 65 kg/ha.
Note: Conduct a soil test for optimal phosphorus and potassium application.
Water Supply/Irrigation
Maintain well-moist soil; irregular irrigation may cause knobs to crack.
Weed Control and Earthing Up
Perform hand weeding 2-3 weeks after transplanting.
Collect soil to the base of the plant at 4-5 weeks.
Pest Management
Common Pests: Looper caterpillar, diamondback moth, black worm.
Follow cabbage pest management practices.
Disease Management
1. Club Root
Causal Organism: Plasmodiophora brassicae.
Symptoms: Swelling or malformation on roots, resembling clubs.
Management:
Maintain soil pH at 7.1 – 7.2 using agricultural lime (2-4 t/ha).
Use disease-free planting materials.
Practice crop rotation.
2. Powdery Mildew
Causal Organism: Erysiphe cruciferarum.
Symptoms: White patches on leaf surfaces, which may show purple blotching and eventually a powdery layer.
Management:
Plant resistant varieties.
Rotate crops.
Remove crop debris after harvest.
Apply surface sprays, dusts, or vapors.
3. Downy Mildew
Causal Organism: Peranospora parasitica.
Symptoms: Yellow patches on leaves that turn brown with white fluffy growth on the underside.
Management:
Cover nurseries to protect from rain.
Remove covers in the morning for sunlight exposure.
Apply a fungicide containing tebuconazole (5 ml/10 liters of water).
Harvesting
Harvest 50-60 days after transplanting.
Knobs should be harvested before becoming too fibrous to maintain quality.
Yield
Intercropping with Cabbage: 8,000 kg/ha.
Intercropping with Curry Chili: 2,200 kg/ha.
