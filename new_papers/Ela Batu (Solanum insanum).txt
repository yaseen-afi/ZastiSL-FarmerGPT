Ela Batu (Solanum insanum)
Overview
Ela Batu, also known as wild eggplant, was traditionally grown in chena (shifting cultivation) but is now cultivated in home gardens and commercially. It is a hardy plant well-suited to dry conditions and can be kept productive for over a year with proper pruning after harvest seasons.

Climatic Requirements
Grows well in low country wet, intermediate, and dry zones, as well as mid-country wet and intermediate zones.
Soil Requirements
Prefers well-drained, light loamy soils.
Optimal pH range: 5.5-5.8.
Seed Requirement
250-300 g per hectare.
Nursery Management
Prepare a raised nursery bed (1 m x 3 m, 15-20 cm high).
Add a 1:1 mix of sieved compost and topsoil.
Sterilize seedbeds by burning straw and paddy husk.
Treat seeds with a recommended fungicide.
Plant seeds 10-15 cm apart at a depth of 0.5-1 cm and cover with a thin soil layer.
Apply a layer of straw mulch and water daily.
Remove mulch after germination.
Harden seedlings by gradually exposing them to sunlight and reducing irrigation for one week before planting.
Seedlings are ready for transplanting after 3-4 weeks.
Land Preparation
Avoid fields previously cropped with Solanaceous plants to reduce bacterial wilt incidence.
Plough the field to a depth of 15-30 cm and prepare 30 x 30 x 30 cm planting holes, incorporating organic matter.
Transplant healthy seedlings (25-30 days old) with four fully expanded leaves.
Cultivation Time
Maha Season: November and December.
Yala Season: April and May.
Establish the nursery one month before planting.
Spacing
90 cm between rows.
60 cm between plants within rows.
Fertilizer Application
Fertilizer Schedule:
Basal Application:
Urea: 75 kg/ha
TSP: 325 kg/ha
MOP: 80-85 kg/ha
Top Dressing (1 month after planting):
Urea: 75 kg/ha
Top Dressing (2 months after planting):
Urea: 75 kg/ha
MOP: 85 kg/ha
Top Dressing (3 months after planting):
Urea: 75 kg/ha
Water Supply
Irrigate every 5 days during dry periods.
Weed Control
Maintain a weed-free field.
Weeds can host insects, so weed control helps reduce pest populations.
Weed before each fertilizer application.
Pest Management
Major pests: Shoot and Fruit Borer (SFB), mites, and hoppers.
Use recommended insecticides to control damage.
Disease Management
Bacterial Wilt: A common and severe disease for Ela Batu.
No chemical control available.
Use deep drains to improve drainage.
Cultivate resistant varieties.
Harvesting and Processing
Harvest begins 10-12 weeks after transplanting.
Up to 10-12 harvests can be done at weekly intervals.
Yield
